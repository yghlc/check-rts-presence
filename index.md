## Check the presence of retrogressive thaw slumps in multi-temporal images or animations


### Introduction

Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) represent a form of permafrost disruption that is drawing increased attention due to its significant impacts on local environments, northern populations, ecosystems, and even global processes like the carbon cycle. With ongoing climate warming, both the frequency and extent of RTSs have risen sharply in recent decades, as shown by numerous site-specific studies. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive information about their regional patterns and long-term dynamics across the broader permafrost landscape, which limits our ability to fully understand and predict permafrost degradation. Mapping RTSs remains challenging because they typically occur in remote, difficult-to-access locations, are relatively small in size, and often resemble surrounding features in remote sensing data, making them hard to distinguish both in the field and from satellite imagery.


We would like to invite people to check if any RTSs show up in images or animations, which were extracted from multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing data using AI techniques. 
The results output by AI contain false positives, so we need to manully inspect these images if they are true (Yes) or false (No) postives.
